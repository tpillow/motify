# Motify

## A simple cross-platform CLI utility for displaying notifications.

Just need to show a notification to the user on any OS? Don't want the native notifications with flaky abilities? Use Motify.

## Developer Resources

Motify uses tkinter, which comes installed with Python 3. All other dependencies can be found in `dependencies.txt` and installed using `pip`.

The `cli` project will eventually be used to make a CLI-based interface for Motify, in case bindings to Python aren't available and someone wishes to use this.
